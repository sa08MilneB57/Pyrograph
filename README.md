# Pyrograph
A relatively simple function plotting program. Mostly a hobby.

# Features
  = Accepts multiple Â±s in the functions drawing all possible values.
  
  = Explicit and parametric functions.
  
  = All functions from modules math and cmath are available
  
# Instructions
To run this, simply open the .py file with your favrourite Python interpreter.

To draw a function type a mathematical expression in python code into the entry bars.

# TO DO FOR FUTURE (In order of priority)
  -Allow users to edit Space configurations by loading the configurations from a text file
  
  -Allow users to save and load functions in text files
  
  -Have UI class inherit from Tk() in tkinter and use UI as your "root"
  
  -Error handling (check for bad user inputs, bad config files)
  
  -Find out why progress bars don't seem to work whenever I try to add them
  
  -Polar coordinate grids.
  
    =Have the labels for y(x) and such change into r(theta)
    
    =Add a "theta" button similar to +- button
    
  -"Complex Mode" allowing automatic handling of complex numbers without user inputing the .real and .imag themselves.
